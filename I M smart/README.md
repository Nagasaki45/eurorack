## Utility mixer with some nice extras in 4 hp

At its basis this module is a 3 channels mixer, but with extra features down its sleeve! The first two channels have dedicated outputs. Connecting a patch cable to these outputs takes channel 1 or 2 out of the mix. Input 1 is normalised to ~+6 volts, so without anything plugged into input 1 the first knob can add positive voltages to the mix or to the dedicated output. Similarly, channel 2 is normalised to ~-6 volts, to add some negative voltages to the mix or to output 2. Channel 3's knob is an attenuverter. This channel is not normalised to anything, because normalised attenuverters are super annoying to set to 0. Lastly, there's only one PCB behind the panel, and a quite low components count, making it relatively cheap and easy build.
